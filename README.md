# Supply-chain Data Science
Some of the supply chain challenges where data science can help:

1. Demand Forecasting 

2. Inventory and SKU Planning 

3. Making the supply chain greener to minimize the environmental impact of global sourcing (e.g., shorter distances or consolidated shipments)

4. Increasing visibility into the supply chain and response time (e.g., through blockchain)

5. Adapting to demographic changes and customer expectations (e.g., free same day deliveries)

6. Allowing manufacturers to decrease their product life-cycle times (e.g., through better market insights and smart sourcing) to react to trends and demand more quickly

7. Increasing the product portfolio to serve not only the mass market but the entire demand curve (e.g., through mass-customization)
