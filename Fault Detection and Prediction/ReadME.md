Industry 4.0 is all about data - how it's collected, analysed, synthesized, interpreted and applied

And that's why predictive maintenance and analytics is such a huge part of the Industry 4.0 - because it's all about using data to predict outcomes and improve performance.

The preventive maintenance instead focuses on equipementsâ€™ life time based on the functioning time.
